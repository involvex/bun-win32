/**
 * published-deps.ts — pre-publish gate: every workspace:* dependency a publishable
 * package declares will be pinned by `bun publish` to the DEPENDENCY's current
 * workspace version (workspace:* -> that exact version). If that version was bumped
 * locally but never published to npm, the published package installs BROKEN — the
 * exact failure that shipped in bun-uia@1.6.0 (it pinned @bun-win32/shcore@1.0.1 and
 * @bun-win32/shell32@1.0.8, which existed only in the workspace, not on npm).
 *
 * preflight.ts is OFFLINE (lockfile <-> package.json) and cannot see this: the dep's
 * package.json version matched the lockfile fine — it just wasn't on the registry.
 *
 * This gate resolves each @bun-win32/* dependency to the version bun publish would pin
 * (the dep package's workspace package.json version) and verifies that version exists
 * on npm. It ALSO verifies packages/uia mcp.ts SERVER_INFO.version matches its
 * package.json (the serverInfo drift that shipped 1.6.0 reporting "1.5.0").
 *
 * Run before every publish (after preflight). Non-zero exit on any problem.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/published-deps.ts
