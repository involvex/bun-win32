/**
 * Flow Field — a few designed ribbons of light sweeping through a divergence-free
 * curl-noise current, drawn by thousands of particles against a premium dark void.
 *
 * A gallery-grade generative-art piece, pure TypeScript, rendered as a TRUECOLOR
 * terminal framebuffer. Several thousand particles live in NORMALIZED [0,1] space
 * and are advected every frame through a CURL-NOISE velocity field: the field is
 * the 2D curl ( ∂ψ/∂y , −∂ψ/∂x ) of a scalar streamfunction ψ. Taking the curl makes
 * the flow exactly divergence-free, so particles neither pile up nor thin out — they
 * glide along smooth, incompressible streamlines that reorganize as ψ evolves.
 *
 * A FOCAL FLOW, not turbulence. ψ is DOMINATED by a smooth diagonal ramp — the
 * streamfunction of a uniform wind — so its curl is one clear sweeping current the eye
 * can follow. Noise octaves (a big gesture, a medium shape, a whisper of filigree) are
 * layered ON TOP to bend that wind into a few large, legible streamlines with finer
 * detail braided inside. A separate low-frequency COMPOSITION field lays a SMALL number
 * of broad RIBBONS by phasing one warped coordinate that runs across the flow, then a
 * slow envelope swells some stretches into a bright focal gesture while others recede —
 * so the frame reads as designed bands with wide NEGATIVE SPACE, never a busy barcode
 * or uniform knot. Particles in the void deposit almost nothing and respawn biased back
 * into a ribbon, so light concentrates into the bands and the surround stays near-black.
 *
 * Each particle deposits a thin ADDITIVE smear into a floating-point HDR accumulation
 * buffer; the whole buffer is MULTIPLIED DOWN a hair every frame, so trails persist as
 * silky ribbons that BLOOM where bands converge and fade where they thin. Color is
 * sampled from a hand-tuned cohesive gradient (deep indigo → teal-blue → violet →
 * magenta → warm coral → gold) indexed by where the particle sits ACROSS its ribbon —
 * a wide cool teal-blue BODY warming only at the bright SPINE — plus speed and a slow
 * drift, never garish. A COLORED separable bloom (each channel blurred) lets the warm
 * gold confluences glow warm and the cool bodies glow cool, an ACES filmic tonemap
 * grades the HDR to 8-bit, and a faint cold vignette keeps the void premium.
 *
 * Everything is in normalized/world space sampled analytically, so the whole field
 * reflows seamlessly on resize at any aspect ratio; the advected particle COUNT scales
 * with the pixel area so per-pixel glow (and cost) stays constant at any grid size — no
 * small-window blowout. All randomness is mulberry32-seeded → captures are
 * deterministic; motion is purely a function of time.
 *
 * Technique: directional-wind + noise streamfunction (one focal sweep, fine detail,
 * divergence-free advection) · phased-band composition field for negative space + a
 * focal swell envelope · across-ribbon cool→warm color ramp · HDR additive trail
 * accumulation with decay · COLORED separable bloom · ACES tonemap · resolution-scaled
 * particle subset for constant density + seamless resize.
