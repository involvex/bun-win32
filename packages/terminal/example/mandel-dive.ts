/**
 * Mandel-Dive — an endless, buttery-smooth plunge into the Mandelbrot set, in a terminal.
 *
 * A continuously zooming Mandelbrot rendered as a half-block TRUECOLOR framebuffer in
 * PURE TypeScript — no GPU, no shader, just doubles and a tight escape-time loop writing
 * straight into the pixel buffer. The camera falls forever toward a hand-picked point on
 * the edge of the seahorse valley (-0.743643887037151, +0.131825904205330), a coordinate
 * whose neighbourhood is self-similar at every scale, so the dive never bottoms out.
 *
 * Four things make it read as designed art rather than a tech demo:
 *
 *   1. CONTINUOUS (normalized) iteration count — the classic log-log smoothing
 *      mu = n + 1 - log2(log2|z|) — erases integer banding for a glassy gradient, fed
 *      through a slowly hue-rotating cosine palette (Inigo-Quilez style) so the whole
 *      fractal breathes. The interior is a deep velvet wash, faintly lit by an orbit trap.
 *
 *   2. DISTANCE-ESTIMATION boundary glow, SOFTENED. We carry the derivative z' alongside z;
 *      the exterior distance estimate dist = |z|·log|z| / |z'| gives the true distance to
 *      the set in screen units. A wide, gently-rolled luminous band is painted from it — a
 *      thread of light that reads as spun gold, never as hard white speckle. The highlight
 *      is soft-clamped (a filmic knee) so the filigree glows without ever blowing out.
 *
 *   3. ADAPTIVE ANTI-ALIASING. The boundary is where a single sample per pixel turns the
 *      sub-pixel filigree into harsh sparkle (a thin bright thread sampled at one point
 *      either hits white or misses entirely). So each pixel takes ONE cheap probe; if the
 *      distance estimate says we are near structure, it supersamples a small rotated grid
 *      and averages in linear light. Calm open field stays 1× cheap; only the rim pays for
 *      smoothness, so the edge resolves into elegant filigree instead of noise.
 *
 *   4. EASED, BREATHING motion. The zoom is an exponential dive shaped by a smootherstep
 *      so it accelerates in and eases at the loop seam; a slow cross-fade across the wrap
 *      makes the re-dive seamless, and a gentle palette drift keeps colour alive over time.
 *
 * Performance is adaptive: the per-pixel iteration budget scales with the LOG of the zoom
 * depth (shallow frames are cheap, deep frames spend more iterations where detail lives)
 * and is capped so the bench stays comfortably >=120 fps at 160x50. It scales to any
 * terminal: the complex view is rederived from t.W/t.H/t.aspect EVERY frame and the whole
 * framebuffer is filled, so the picture reflows on live resize. All motion derives purely
 * from the sim clock (time/dt); any jitter is seeded with mulberry32, so captures are
 * deterministic frame-for-frame.
 *
 * Technique: escape-time z=z^2+c in doubles · normalized-iteration (log-log) smooth colour ·
 * softened exterior distance-estimation rim w/ filmic highlight knee · adaptive boundary
 * supersampling (linear-light average) · cosine palette w/ time-rotated hue · log-depth
 * adaptive iter budget · smootherstep-eased exponential zoom w/ cross-fade loop · ACES-graded.
