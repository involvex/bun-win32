/**
 * owned-modal-dialog — the "drive in the dark" gap: an owned MODAL dialog that does NOT grab the foreground (the app is
 * in the background / minimized) was invisible to the agent — ownedForegroundDialog only fires when the dialog holds
 * the foreground, so the agent kept acting on a parent the modal had already disabled. ownedModalDialog detects it by
 * the canonical modal signal: the owner is DISABLED and a visible top-level window is owned by it — foreground or not.
 *
 * Proof: synthesize a real owned dialog (CreateWindowExW with the owner as hWndParent), disable the owner the way a
 * modal does, and — without giving the dialog the foreground — assert ownedForegroundDialog MISSES it (0n) while
 * ownedModalDialog FINDS it; then re-enable the owner and assert the modal detector goes quiet (no non-modal false
 * fire). Both windows are destroyed in teardown.
 *
 * bun test is broken repo-wide — runnable harness (raw Win32 windows, no app spawned):
 * Run: bun run example/owned-modal-dialog.integration.test.ts
