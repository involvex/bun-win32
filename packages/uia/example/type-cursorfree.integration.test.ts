/**
 * type-cursorfree — the computer-use `type` / `key` / `hold_key` actions ignored the cursorless option and ALWAYS used
 * SendInput (system focus), unlike every click/scroll verb (which honor cursorless and post messages). So a client
 * driving via dispatch() could not type / press a key cursor-free even though input.ts already exports postText /
 * postKey / postHoldKey (the same primitives the MCP type/press_key tools use). dispatch() now mirrors that path:
 * when cursorless and the FOCUSED control (or its nearest window-owning ancestor) owns a real HWND it POSTS WM_CHAR /
 * WM_KEYDOWN to it (cursor-free), and only falls to SendInput otherwise. With cursorless:false the contract is unchanged.
 *
 * CUA key/type semantically target AMBIENT (global) keyboard focus — there is NO element ref — and UIA's
 * GetFocusedElement is system-global. A background test process cannot legitimately steal global focus
 * (SetForegroundWindow is blocked by the OS foreground lock), and posting real text/keys to whatever DOES own focus
 * would inject into the user's foreground app. So this proves the routing without injecting anything:
 *   • a cursorless `type` of the EMPTY string posts ZERO WM_CHARs yet still takes the cursor-free branch (postText
 *     returns true for a non-zero HWND) — reported "(cursor-free)" only WITH the fix (old code unconditionally
 *     SendInput'd and never said cursor-free), and the real mouse never moves; gated on the ambient focus owning an
 *     HWND (read-only probe), since a HWND-less focus correctly falls back.
 *   • a cursorless:false `type` reports the SendInput path (the unchanged fallback contract) — and SendInput with no
 *     foregrounded editor is a harmless no-op.
 * Nothing is spawned and nothing is typed into any window.
 *
 * bun test is broken repo-wide — runnable script:
 * Run: bun run example/type-cursorfree.integration.test.ts
