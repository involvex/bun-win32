/**
 * pattern-no-raise — the foreground-stability REGRESSION GUARD for the UIA control-pattern act paths
 * (`setValue` / `toggle` / `invoke`). cursor-free-input proves only the POSTED paths (WM_SETTEXT/WM_CHAR/WM_KEY/
 * WM_PASTE) leave the foreground untouched; the pattern-vcall paths had NO such guard, and a click() on an own-HWND
 * WinUI control happens to take the posted-click branch — so the focus-stealing pattern-vcall path went un-asserted.
 *
 * Reality this LOCKS (probed live): on a classic Win32 control that owns its own HWND (charmap's RICHEDIT50W edit,
 * the "Advanced view" checkbox, the "Select" button), a UIA pattern act (ValuePattern.SetValue, TogglePattern.Toggle,
 * InvokePattern.Invoke) goes through the OS UIA→provider bridge, which ACTIVATES the control's own window — so the
 * foreground moves to that CONTROL's HWND. That OS-bridge activation is unavoidable for these patterns on classic
 * Win32 (UIPI/OS wall), so — per the PARITY LAW — this test asserts the HONEST documented outcome rather than a fake
 * "no-raise" success (mirroring click-minimized-honest): the foreground may move to the acted CONTROL's own HWND, but
 * it MUST NOT raise charmap's TOP-LEVEL window, and the app window MUST stay minimized. If a future fix ever routes
 * own-HWND pattern acts through the posted path, the foreground would stay fully unchanged — this test accepts that
 * stronger outcome too (it only fails if the parent app window is raised or charmap is un-minimized).
 *
 * bun test is broken repo-wide for FFI; runnable harness (spawns + taskkills its own charmap):
 * Run: bun run example/pattern-no-raise.integration.test.ts
