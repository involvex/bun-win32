/**
 * open-path-safe — open_path must NOT be command-injectable.
 *
 * The handler used `cmd /c start "" <path>`, and cmd re-parses its arguments, so a path containing shell
 * metacharacters (`"` `&` `%VAR%`) injected arbitrary commands — behind a benign "open with the default handler"
 * label, grantable in isolation via BUN_UIA_ALLOW=open_path. openPath() now uses ShellExecuteW: the path is a real
 * lpFile string, no shell, no command-line re-parse.
 *
 * Proof (side-effect-free): a path crafted to drop a sentinel file IF re-parsed by a shell opens nothing and the
 * sentinel is NEVER created; openPath returns false (ShellExecuteW HINSTANCE <= 32 for the bogus filename).
 *
 * bun test is broken repo-wide — runnable harness (spawns no app/window; ShellExecuteW on a bogus file just errors):
 * Run: bun run example/open-path-safe.integration.test.ts
