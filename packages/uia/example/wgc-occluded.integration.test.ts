/**
 * wgc-occluded — PROVE the README headline: `captureWindowLive` reads the LIVE pixels of a window even when it
 * is fully OCCLUDED in the background, with NO foregrounding — the "see a window even when it's not visible"
 * capability that Windows.Graphics.Capture exists to deliver and that finding/08 mandates be SEEN, not asserted.
 *
 * Headline target: classic Notepad — a real top-level Win32 window that WGC composites and captures occluded at
 * full size, first try, on this build (measured: 2550x1387, ~10.6M nonzero px behind a maximized Explorer, not
 * foreground, not minimized). The proof (finding/08-WGC-BACKGROUND-CAPTURE.md:55-61):
 *  1. capture it VISIBLE → WGC returns a non-uniform frame (baseline: the chain works at all);
 *  2. FULLY OCCLUDE it under a maximized Explorer WITHOUT foregrounding it — assert it is NOT the foreground
 *     window and NOT minimized (so it is genuinely behind another window, not raised or iconified);
 *  3. capture it OCCLUDED → `captureWindowLive` MUST return non-null AND non-uniform (the live, background pixels);
 *  4. also grab `captureWindowRGB` (PrintWindow) for the side-by-side the README sells — written to disk to SEE.
 *
 * Companion (best-effort, SKIP-not-FAIL): the WinUI/XAML Calculator — a DirectComposition (GPU-composited) surface.
 * It is the harder, less-reliable case: a packaged single-instance app whose ActivationManager can be left wedged
 * by a prior session, and whose composed surface can return blank within a short poll. So Calculator is captured
 * as a SECONDARY assertion that SKIPs when it cannot be launched or when its surface comes back blank — never a
 * FAIL — so a poisoned app model degrades gracefully instead of bricking this test (and the rest of the suite).
 *
 * Honest scope (measured on Win 11 26200, not hand-waved): WGC seeing the OCCLUDED surface is the load-bearing,
 * differentiating claim and is asserted hard here on the reliable Notepad surface. The companion "PrintWindow
 * returns blank for this" half is content- and OS-build-dependent (modern DWM re-renders many composition
 * surfaces into PrintWindow's DC, so it is NOT reliably blank) — captured for the eyeball side-by-side but NOT
 * asserted. The first WGC frame on a cold pool can be empty within a short timeout — so the captures use a
 * generous first-frame timeout and a small retry, the same warm-up a caller wanting the occluded frame should use.
 *
 * Teardown (finally): every window this test spawns is closed/force-killed by its OWN owning process id
 * (finding/31) — NEVER `taskkill /F /IM`, which by image name wedges a single-instance packaged app's
 * ActivationManager and leaves it unlaunchable for the whole session. The Explorer occluder is WM_CLOSE'd (a
 * file-Explorer window can share the shell PID), Notepad/Calculator are force-killed by their window's PID only.
 *
 * bun test is broken repo-wide for FFI; runnable harness:
 * Run: bun run example/wgc-occluded.integration.test.ts
