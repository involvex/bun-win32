/**
 * wait-for-state — waitForState (the Playwright expect(locator).toBeChecked()/toHaveValue()/toBeEnabled() analogue)
 * existed in the library (Element.waitForState) but the MCP/agent surface could NOT reach it: the wait_for tool only
 * branched on appear vs gone:true. This wires a `state` object into wait_for so a client can RETRY until a control
 * reaches a state instead of polling appear + re-snapshot + parse by hand.
 *
 * Proof (against a spawned Notepad — its Document "Text editor" is ALWAYS enabled, an on-any-host target the taskbar
 * StartButton was NOT): wait_for {state:{enabled:true}} on the Document RESOLVES with "reached"; {state:{enabled:false}}
 * on the same control TIMES OUT quoting the "last seen" state; an EMPTY state is REJECTED. Before the fix, state was
 * ignored — wait_for returned "matched" (appear) and never timed out on a state mismatch, so every assertion below
 * fails. The Notepad is closed in finally with closeWindow (WM_CLOSE), then force-killed by ITS OWN pid as a backstop
 * (modern WinUI Notepad survives WM_CLOSE) — taskkill /F /PID of the spawned process only, never /IM (which would
 * close a user's other Notepad tabs).
 *
 * This used to gate the headline on the taskbar StartButton + an inline assert/PASS-exit, so a host without that
 * control printed a green PASS having run ONLY the two schema-shape assertions — a vacuous PASS. It now uses _harness
 * (a fully-skipped run is INCONCLUSIVE exit 2, never a green PASS) and an on-any-host Notepad Document target.
 *
 * bun test is broken repo-wide — runnable harness (MCP subprocess + a spawned Notepad):
 * Run: bun run example/wait-for-state.integration.test.ts
