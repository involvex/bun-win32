/**
 * launch-app-new-window — launch_app {command, title} must attach to the window THIS launch created, not to a
 * same-titled window the user already had open. The old impl did `Bun.spawn(...)` then `waitForWindow({title})`, and
 * waitForWindow returns ANY already-open substring-title match IMMEDIATELY — so with a Notepad already open,
 * launch_app attached to the STALE one while confidently reporting "launched and attached", the worst failure mode for
 * an autonomous agent (no error to recover from). The handler now snapshots already-open matches BEFORE spawning and
 * resolves only a window NOT in that set (preferring the spawned pid), so launch_app means "the window this launch made".
 *
 * Proof: pre-open a Notepad and stamp a unique marker into its document via set_value. Then launch_app {title:'Notepad'}.
 * The fix must attach to a DIFFERENT hWnd than the marked one and its snapshot must NOT carry the marker.
 *
 * Every spawned Notepad is closed in the finally. bun test is broken repo-wide — runnable harness (full profile for the
 * os category + input to stamp the marker):
 * Run: bun run example/launch-app-new-window.integration.test.ts
