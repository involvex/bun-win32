// optional ref + children), so both UiaNode (uia.tree) and RefNode (snapshots) diff with no cast.

// position reads as a rename, not appear+disappear. Each path segment is the child's automationId
// when it has one (a stable identity), else its index — so inserting a sibling (e.g. a result Text)
