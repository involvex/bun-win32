/**
 * Particle Galaxy — a 4-MILLION-star self-gravitating N-body galaxy, in pure TypeScript.
 *
 * A borderless ~16:9 window fills with a living, spinning spiral galaxy of 4,194,304
 * GPU-compute stars whose motion is REAL PHYSICS — not a scripted animation. Every star
 * carries an integrated POSITION, VELOCITY and its OWN MASS (drawn from a Salpeter stellar
 * IMF — a multitude of faint dwarfs and a rare few brilliant blue-white giants). Each frame a
 * chain of Direct3D 11 compute shaders (HLSL JIT-compiled at runtime over Bun FFI) advances the
 * whole disk with a symplectic leapfrog integrator under THREE genuine forces:
 *
 *   • a heavy softened CENTRAL BLACK HOLE — an invisible point mass the disk orbits, wrapped in
 *     a brilliant golden nuclear star cluster whipping around it on fast Keplerian orbits;
 *   • a smooth extended dark-matter HALO that flattens the outer rotation curve; and
 *   • GENUINE PER-STAR SELF-GRAVITY — every star deposits its own mass (Cloud-in-Cell, atomic)
 *     onto a 2-D particle-mesh field; a warm-started Jacobi relaxation solves the Poisson
 *     equation ∇²φ = source for the gravitational potential φ; each star then feels a_self =
 *     -∇φ at its position. So neighbours genuinely ATTRACT, dense regions deepen their own
 *     wells, giants anchor their surroundings, and spiral arms / clumps / dust lanes / spurs
 *     SELF-ORGANISE — they are GROWN by gravity, not painted on. A blast that removes mass from
 *     a region is felt, with real geometry, by everything around it.
 *
 * The galaxy is seeded as a SMOOTH, warm exponential disk + bulge — NOT a painted spiral — carrying
 * only a faint few-percent log-spiral density perturbation to break symmetry. At startup the field
 * solver is run once and each star's circular speed is reseeded from the MEASURED azimuthally-
 * averaged force (true thin-disk equilibrium, no spherical approximation), so the disk starts in
 * genuine balance and does NOT ring up. The live self-gravity then GROWS the arms by swing
 * amplification and differential rotation — they wind, feather, grow spurs and asymmetry, and
 * regenerate as recurrent transient spirals. The disk is tuned cool enough (Toomre Q≈1.3) to be
 * genuinely self-gravitating yet warm enough to favour open spirals over axisymmetric rings; the
 * black-hole + halo backbone keeps it globally stable. Gravity is softened near r=0 so the core can
 * never fling a star to infinity (no NaN, no blow-up). Stars that plunge into the black hole or
 * escape the rim respawn on fresh circular orbits, so the disk never depletes or disperses.
 *
 * INTERACTIONS inject REAL velocity, so momentum PERSISTS — releasing a button never
 * snaps stars back; the disk keeps moving and re-settles under its own gravity:
 *   • LEFT click  = BANG    — a one-shot radial OUTWARD impulse near the cursor (Gaussian
 *                             falloff) + an exposure/bloom FLASH; stars blast out, then fall
 *                             back and re-settle over seconds.
 *   • RIGHT hold  = IMPLODE — a strong moving gravity attractor at the cursor sucks stars in;
 *                             on release their momentum carries them onward.
 *   • MIDDLE hold = VORTEX  — a tangential swirl + mild inward pull: a real whirlpool that
 *                             keeps spinning after release.
 * The cursor is unprojected as a true ray onto the disk plane y=0 using the SAME orbiting
 * camera the scene renders with, so the well lands exactly under the pointer.
 *
 * Each star is rendered with NO vertex buffer: a vertex shader expands it into a soft additive
 * billboard quad (6 verts/star via SV_VertexID), projected through the cinematic orbiting camera
 * and coloured by REAL dynamics AND the live emergent structure — it samples the live density field
 * so young hot-blue stars light up exactly where gravity has GROWN a dense arm; plus a golden bulge,
 * cool red outskirts, relativistic Doppler beaming on the fast inner cluster, and mass-driven size.
 * Quads accumulate with pure-additive blending into an HDR R16G16B16A16_FLOAT target. Then a screen-
 * space FX pass makes the centre LEGIBLE (a brilliant compact accretion glow + gravitational-lensing
 * warp + faint Einstein ring marking the black hole) and lights the dense arms with H-alpha pink +
 * OIII cyan STAR-FORMING NEBULAE; interstellar DUST reads the same density grid to redden + darken
 * the disk into dark lanes; rare SUPERNOVA flashes bloom and fade (opt-in, GAL_SN=1); and a multi-resolution BLOOM
 * chain, ACES filmic tonemap, chroma recovery, a deep-space STARFIELD + gradient and a vignette
 * compose the back buffer. A flicker-free GDI HUD reads the live star count + fps.
 *
 * The self-gravity is MOMENTUM-CONSERVING and self-force-free: mass is deposited with a CIC kernel,
 * the grid force g=-∇φ is then interpolated back to each star with the SAME kernel, and a small
 * timestep keeps the stiff nucleus stable — so the disk runs as a near-conservative system with no
 * artificial drag or clamps (energy drift ~0.1%/s; verify with ENERGY_PROBE=1). Only clicks inject
 * energy. Stars unbound by a blast genuinely escape; a softened-core respawn protects the integrator.
 *
 * Pipeline (per physics sub-step, off a PeekMessage pump):
 *   1. CS clearGrid         — zero the GRID_N² density cells
 *   2. CS deposit  (CIC)    — each star atomically splats its OWN mass onto 4 field cells
 *   3. CS source            — de-scale cell mass → Poisson source
 *   4. CS jacobi ×K         — warm-started relaxation → gravitational potential φ
 *   5. CS force             — grid force g=-∇φ (central difference), for matched CIC interpolation
 *   6. CS integrate (KDK)   — leapfrog: black hole + halo + CIC(a_self) + interactions, respawn
 *   7. HDR splat (additive) — 4M billboards, blackbody colour, live-density arm lighting, Doppler
 *   8. DUST extinction      — live density grid reddens + darkens before bloom → dark dust lanes
 *   9. FX pass              — legible BH (accretion glow + lensing) + HII nebulae (supernovae opt-in)
 *  10. bright → 3× down+blur → composite (ACES + starfield) → back buffer + GDI HUD
 *
 * CONTROLS: left-DRAG orbits the cinematic camera, the WHEEL (or arrows) zooms; LEFT-click = bang,
 * RIGHT = implode, MIDDLE = vortex; C launches a galaxy COLLISION (a heavy intruder shown as a
 * VISIBLE companion nucleus on a close grazing pass, shearing the disk into real tidal tails + a
 * bridge, with an eased camera — no jolt); SPACE pauses (a true freeze you can still orbit), [ / ]
 * slow / speed time, . steps one frame; H toggles a help overlay; R resets; ESC exits.
 *
 * @bun-win32 / engine APIs (from ./_gpu, ./_gpu3d, ./_hud, ./_snapshot).
 *
 * Run: bun run packages/all/example/particle-galaxy.ts   (drag orbit · wheel zoom · C collide · H help)
 *   SELFSHOT=1 SELFSHOT_PATH=<abs.png> SELFSHOT_T=<simSeconds> DEMO_DURATION_MS=<ms> — capture a frame.
 *   ENERGY_PROBE=1 measures total-energy conservation; GAL_* env vars tune every physics/visual knob.
